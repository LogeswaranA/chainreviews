# BLOCKCHAIN POWERED DECENTRALIZED REVIEWS & REWARDS SYSTEM
- Implemented a DAPP to create a platform for Reviews & Rewards System on Ethereum Framework.

# CONNECTING THE BLOCKS
- We worked on this project at #ETHINDIA HACKATHON. Not to miss, but as a team (Lokesh, Shishir and me) made this up and working.

- Please have a look at the video that we have in README_version_1.md, to get the background of the project.

- Just to summarize, I would love to mention in few line

> We have lot of reviewers accross the world. People are putting up there efforts to give reviews. If they are moving to a new platform, then they have to put their efforts all over again. We thought to bring it on Decentralized system where we can give our product as open source API and also as a stand alone appliction. The Application users will upvote and downvote a reviewer. Based on the upvote and downvote we give them some bounties. We were removing the third party influence and making the system more efficient for reviewers.  

- Now, let's disuss, why which point we missed in Hackathon.

> Question was: HOW WE WILL PROTECT OUR SYSTEM FROM MALICIOUS THIRD PARTY USERS. SUPPOSE, A PERSON HACKS OUR SITE AND BECOMES MORE POWERFUL USING UPVOTES.

# THIS QUESTION IS WHAT I THINK, WE SHOULD RESOLVE NOW
- It's Opensource. come and suggest us.

- My suggestion is: 
* Our system will create a side chain automatically in regular duration of time. 
* It will search for powerful annonymous users and makes a list. 
* Then, it will randomly select some nodes from that side chain and ask them to verify.
* Obvious, we will reward the reviewing nodes.
* And if any malicious user is found, we will block them and ask them to verify their Identity.
* We can use the concept of Polkadots


# REVENUE MODEL
- Obvious, without the REVENUE MODEL, things are of no use.

* Our review system will earn through our booking system. 
* We have a plan to build a one stop booking system for travellers.



LET'S MAKE IT ALIVE !!!
